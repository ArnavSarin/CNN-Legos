# CNN-Legos
 Programmed a CNN from scratch to identify 10 distinctive LEGO blocks without utilizing preexisting libraries such as PyTorch, Keras, Tensor Flow etc. 
 Constructed a multilayer network consisting of 3x3 kernel convolution layers, max pooling layers and leaky RELU activation function.
 Distributed the calculation workload on an AMD RADEON RX 6800 GPU by parallelizing Feature Learning, Classification and Back Propogation with
 the PyOpenCl library. Thereby increasing time efficiency by 200x.
